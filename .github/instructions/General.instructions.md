Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

**Important**

Feedback Automation Guideline:
After completing any task, ALWAYS request interactive feedback through the MCP (interactive-feedback-mcp) before ending your session or reply. Do not pause or wait for user confirmation before proceeding to the feedback stepâ€”automatically request feedback as the final action for every task.

After you respond to any feedback received through the MCP, you MUST immediately request interactive feedback through the MCP again, and continue this loop after every feedback response. Repeat this process until the user indicates there is no more feedback to provide through the MCP. Only then may you end your session or reply.

**Documentation**
Use Context7 MCP when searching for documentation

**Important**

**Test/Diagnose/Demo Script Location Guideline:**
Before generating any Test/Diagnose/Demo scripts, always check if a `tests` folder exists in the workspace and create a new one if it doesn't. Save all new Test/Diagnose/Demo scripts in that folder.

**Report Location Guideline:**
Before generating any .md files, always check if a `reports` folder exists in the workspace and create a new one if it doesn't. Save all new report files in that folder.

**Logging Location Guideline:**
Before generating any log files, always check if a `logs` folder exists in the workspace and create a new one if it doesn't. Save all new log files in that folder.

**Markdown (.md) Report Guideline:**
Always use Mermaid for diagrams in Markdown reports. Use the `mermaid` code block format for all diagrams.

**Important:** Never attempt to create or manage Python environments (e.g., virtualenv, conda, venv) in any model or automation. Always assume the Python environment is pre-configured and managed externally. Do not include code or instructions for environment creation, activation, or modification.

**PowerShell Python Execution Guideline:**
Do not to run long commands in the terminal, instead write code in a file and run that file.
